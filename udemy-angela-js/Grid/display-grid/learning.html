        Bali is predominantly a Hindu country. Bali is known for its elaborate,
        traditional dancing. The dancing is inspired by its Hindi beliefs. Most
        of the dancing portrays tales of good versus evil. To watch the dancing
        is a breathtaking experience.

        Bali has some spectacular temples. The most significant is the Mother
        Temple, Besakih. The inhabitants of Lombok are mostly Muslim with a
        Hindu minority. Lombok remains the most understated of the two islands.
        Lombok has several temples worthy of a visit, though they are less
        prolific. Bali and Lombok are neighbouring islands.

        Artists can be seen whittling and painting on the streets, particularly
        in Ubud. It is easy to appreciate each island as an attractive tourist
        destination. Majestic scenery; rich culture; white sands and warm, azure
        waters draw visitors like magnets every year. Snorkelling and diving
        around the nearby Gili Islands is magnificent. Marine fish, starfish,
        turtles and coral reef are present in abundance. Bali and Lombok are
        part of the Indonesian archipelago.

        Lombok has some impressive points of interest – the majestic Gunung
        Rinjani is an active volcano. It is the second highest peak in
        Indonesia. Art is a Balinese passion. Batik paintings and carved statues
        make popular souvenirs.
